# Tokenizer Project

This project implements a simple tokenizer for a programming language-like syntax. The tokenizer reads input strings and splits them into meaningful tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and constants. Limited number of inputs are recogonized.

## Features
- Tokenization of keywords such as `return`, `while`, and `if`.
- Handling of operators like `==`, `!=`, `&&`, and `||`.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++11 or higher

### Installation
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOURGITNAME/tokenizer-project.git
   ```
--- Change main string input to desired input
